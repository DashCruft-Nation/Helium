## üëæ Development

Lazap is fully open-source and can be compiled from source.

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (It should already come with Rust installation)
- [Latest Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yet Another Resource Negotiator](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)

Once you have the above preqs, you may continue with the following:

```bash
# clone this repo 
git clone https://github.com/Lazap-Development/Lazap.git 
# change current dir, install deps
cd Lazap && yarn install
# run in development mode
yarn tauri dev
```

### Windows Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) Error
Sometimes, yarn doesn't works very well, this can be due to error during installation or oudated nodejs version a potential fix is given below:

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have latest nodejs and yarn installed correctly.
> If not, then install yarn from [here](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases), and add this to path. 
 
1. Remove .yarn and yarn.lock
```ps1
# remove .yarn
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .yarn
# remove yarn.lock
Remove-Item yarn.lock
```
2. Update `.yarnrc.yml`
```yml
#remove yarnPath from the .yarnrc.yml
yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-4.1.1.cjs
#leave nodeLinker as is, its 100% correct
```

3. Install Dependencies
```bash
#install deps
yarn install
# run in development mode
yarn tauri dev
```
